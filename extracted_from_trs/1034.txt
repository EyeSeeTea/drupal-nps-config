1.1 Hallucinogen
1.1.1 5-Methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT)
Substance identification
5-Methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (abbreviation: 5-MeO-DALT; chemical
name: N-allyl-N-(2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)prop-2-en-1-amine) is
a synthetic hallucinogen. It is a solid, crystalline powder described as white,
off-white, grey, light brown or tan. It has also been found as yellow, purple or
green tablets.

WHO review history
5-MeO-DALT has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not currently
under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s attention that
this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to public health and
has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
5-MeO-DALT has a chemical structure similar to that of the hallucinogen
3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]indole (DMT), which is listed under Schedule I
of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. 5-MeO-DALT binds
to various receptors, with no clear mechanism of action; the receptors include
serotoninergic, adrenergic, histamine, kappa opioid receptors and sigma
receptors, as well as the dopamine and serotonin transporters (DAT and
SERT).
        Its pharmacological profile in studies in laboratory animals indicates that
the effects of 5-MeO-DALT are consistent with those of hallucinogens
such as (−)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM) and lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD), although some effects differ from those of other
hallucinogens.

Dependence potential
No controlled experimental studies to determine the probable dependence
potential of 5-MeO-DALT have been reported, although unvalidated reports
on online forums describe the development of tolerance when 5-MeO-DALT
was used daily. As it is similar to DOM, 5-MeO-DALT would be expected to
have little potential to produce dependence.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Preclinical studies suggest that 5-MeO-DALT has abuse potential, as it shares
discriminative stimulus effects with DOM. No studies to determine the abuse
liability of 5-MeO-DALT in humans have been reported.
5-MeO-DALT is sold online, and sales and seizures have been reported in
many countries in several regions. A few reports have been made of adverse
effects, including agitation and aggression, related to possible use of 5-MeO-
DALT. The presence of the substance was not, however, biologically confirmed
in the majority of cases.

Therapeutic usefulness
5-MeO-DALT is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
5-Methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine or 5-MeO-DALT (chemical name: N-allyl-
N-(2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)prop-2-en-1-amine)) is a synthetic
hallucinogen with some effects similar to those of other hallucinogens such
as DOM that are controlled under Schedule I of the 1971 Convention on
Psychotropic Substances. Its mode of action is unclear, and there is very
limited information on its effects in humans. While its use may constitute
a risk to public health, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend
international control.
              Recommendation: The Committee recommended that 5-methoxy-N,N-
diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT, chemical name: N-allyl-N-(2-(5-methoxy-
1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)prop-2-en-1-amine)) be kept under surveillance by the
WHO Secretariat.

1.1 Stimulant
1.1.1 3-Fluorophenmetrazine (3-FPM)
Substance identification
3-Fluorophenmetrazine (chemical name: 2-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-
methylmorpholine) is also known as 3F-phenmetrazine, 3-FPM, 3-FPH and
PAL-593. 3-Fluorophenmetrazine is a white, solid, crystalline powder and has
been found as tablets.

WHO review history
3-Fluorophenmetrazine has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not
currently under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s
attention that this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to
public health and is of no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
3-Fluorophenmetrazine is a derivative of phenmetrazine, an amphetamine-
type substance listed under Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic
Substances of 1971, with known abuse potential. 3-Fluorophenmetrazine is a
potent releaser of dopamine and norepinephrine.
In humans, its effects are similar to those of amphetamine and include
euphoria, stimulation, increased energy, talkativeness and insomnia. Adverse
effects include tachycardia, agitation, delirium and seizures.

Dependence potential
3-fluorophenmetrazine is a derivative of phenmetrazine, an amphetamine-
type substance listed under Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic
Substances of 1971, with known abuse potential. 3-fluorophenmetrazine is a
potent releaser of dopamine and norepinephrine.
In humans, its effects are similar to those of amphetamine and include
euphoria, stimulation, increased energy, talkativeness and insomnia. Adverse
effects include tachycardia, agitation, delirium and seizures.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Given the structural similarity between 3-fluorophenmetrazine and
phenmetrazine (a stimulant with known abuse liability) and biological
effects similar to those of amphetamine-like substances (i.e. through release
of dopamine and norepinephrine), 3-fluorophenmetrazine is expected to
have similar abuse potential; however, there is no evidence to confirm this
assumption.
        Case reports have been published of adverse effects including tachycardia,
reduced level of consciousness, agitation, anxiety, delirium and, less
commonly, kidney damage, hypertension and fatal intoxication. The role of
3-fluorophenmetrazine in the limited number of serious non-fatal and fatal
intoxications was, however, inconclusive.
              Samples purchased online, as either 3-fluorophenmetrazine or other
substances, have been identified as containing 3-fluorophenmetrazine.
Seizures have been described in six countries in several regions.

Therapeutic usefulness
3-Fluorophenmetrazine is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
3-Fluorophenmetrazine (chemical name: 2-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-
methylmorpholine) has a mode of action and effects similar to those of
phenmetrazine, an amphetamine-type substance listed under Schedule II of
the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. While this suggests that
it has a potential for dependence and the likelihood of abuse, there is little
supportive evidence. In addition, there is no evidence of the extent of public
health and social problems related to use of 3-fluorophenmetrazine and some
uncertainty about its toxicity.
            Recommendation: The Committee recommended that 3-fluorophenmetrazine
(chemical name: 2-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-methylmorpholine) be kept under
surveillance by the WHO Secretariat.

1.1 Dissociatives
1.1.1 3-Methoxyphencyclidine (3-MeO-PCP)
Substance identification
3-Methoxyphencyclidine (3-MeO-PCP) (chemical name:
1-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine) is an arylcyclohexylamine and
a 3-methoxy derivative of phencyclidine (PCP), which is controlled under
Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. It is found
as a powder and tablets.

WHO review history
3-methoxyphencyclidine has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not
currently under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s
attention that this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to
public health and has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
3-methoxyphencyclidine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonist with a mechanism of action and effects similar to those of PCP.
The effects include an altered mental state characterized by confusion,
disorientation and out-of-body experiences as well as hallucinations and other
psychotic symptoms.

Dependence potential
No studies have been reported in animals or humans on the dependence
potential of 3-methoxyphencyclidine.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
As 3-methoxyphencyclidine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, it would be
expected to have similar effects and similar abuse potential to those of PCP.
The adverse effects include cardiovascular effects (such as hypertension
and tachycardia) and cognitive effects including psychosis, confusion and
agitation. People with a history of or vulnerability to psychotic illness may be
at greater risk of psychosis. Cases of severe and fatal intoxication have been
reported from several countries and regions.
Seizures have been reported in a number of countries in several regions.

Therapeutic usefulness
3-methoxyphencyclidine is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
3-Methoxyphencyclidine (chemical name: 1-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)
cyclohexyl]piperidine) is an analogue of and has similar effects to PCP, which
is controlled under Schedule II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic
Substances. Its mode of action suggests a likelihood of abuse. There is
evidence that this substance is used in a number of countries in various
regions. 3-Methoxyphencyclidine causes substantial harm, including severe
adverse events such as hallucinations, other psychotic symptoms and fatal
intoxications. It has no therapeutic use.
               Recommendation: The Committee recommended that
3-methoxyphencyclidine (chemical name: 1-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)
cyclohexyl]piperidine) be added to Schedule II of the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971.

1.1.1 Diphenidine
Substance identification
Diphenidine (chemical name: 1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperidine) is a
dissociative and hallucinogenic substance of the 1,2-diarylethylamine class. It
is found as a powder and in tablets.

WHO review history
Diphenidine has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not currently
under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s attention that
this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to public health and
has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Diphenidine is known to produce hallucinogenic and dissociative effects
through its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist. This mechanism of action
and its effects are similar to those of PCP, which is controlled under Schedule
II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

Dependence potential
No studies have been reported in animals or humans on the dependence
potential of diphenidine.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
As diphenidine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, it would be expected to
have abuse potential similar to that of PCP. In addition, diphenidine causes
the release of dopamine, in a manner similar to but to a lesser degree than
cocaine. This effect may also contribute to its abuse potential.
Cases of intoxication requiring hospitalization have been reported.
Adverse effects include cardiovascular effects (such as tachycardia and
hypertension) and central nervous system effects, including hallucinations,
depersonalization, delusions, paranoia, dissociation, confusion, nystagmus
and muscle rigidity. These effects have resulted in acute intoxication requiring
emergency admission. A small number of fatal intoxications involving
diphenidine have been documented. All the deaths involved multiple drugs;
however, the cardiovascular and hallucinogenic symptoms described were
consistent with the effects of diphenidine.
Seizures have been reported in a number of countries in several regions.

Therapeutic usefulness
Diphenidine is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
The available evidence indicates that the mechanism of action and effects of
diphenidine (chemical name: 1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperidine) are similar to
those of PCP, which is controlled under Schedule II of the 1971 Convention
on Psychotropic Substances. Its mode of action suggests the potential for
abuse. There is evidence that diphenidine causes significant harm, including
psychosis and cardiovascular effects, representing a substantial risk to public
health. Diphenidine has no therapeutic use.
        Recommendation: The Committee recommended that diphenidine (chemical
name: 1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperidine) be added to Schedule II of the
Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.

1.1.1 2-Methoxydiphenidine (2-MeO-DIPHENIDINE)
Substance identification
2-Methoxydiphenidine (chemical name: 1-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-
phenylethyl]piperidine) is also known as 2-MeO-diphenidine, 2-MXP and
methoxphenidine. It is a dissociative and hallucinogenic substance of the
1,2-diarylethylamine class. It is found as a powder and tablets.

WHO review history
2-methoxydiphenidine has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not
currently under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s
attention that this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to
public health and has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Like PCP, 2-methoxydiphenidine is an NMDA receptor antagonist and
has PCP-like effects. Phencyclidine is controlled under Schedule II of the
Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.

Dependence potential
No studies have been reported in animals or humans on the dependence
potential of 2-methoxydiphenidine.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
As 2-methoxydiphenidine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, its effects and
abuse potential would be expected to be similar to those of PCP.
A few case reports, often involving multiple substances, describe adverse
effects, including acute behavioural effects such as agitation, sedation,
depersonalization, hallucinations, delusions and paranoia and physical effects
such as tachycardia, syncope and hyperthermia. Online forums present
reports from individuals describing its use and effects such as euphoria.
While reports of 2-methoxydiphenidine use and its harm are available from a
number of countries, these have been less frequent during the past two years,
and it is possible that there is no longer significant use of this substance.

Therapeutic usefulness
2-methoxydiphenidine is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
2-Methoxydiphenidine (chemical name: 1-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-
phenylethyl]piperidine) has a mechanism of action similar to that of PCP.
Its use has been declining in recent years. There is insufficient evidence
of a public health or social problem at this time to warrant placing
2-methoxydiphenidine under international control.
                     Recommendation: The Committee recommended that 2-Methoxydiphenidine
(chemical name: 1-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethyl]piperidine) be kept
under surveillance by the WHO Secretariat.

1.1 Synthetic opioid
1.1.1 Isotonitazene
Substance identification
Isotonitazene (chemical name: N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-isopropoxybenzyl)-
5-nitro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)ethan-1-amine) belongs to the
2-benzylbenzimidazole group of compounds, which include the closely
related opioids etonitazene, metonitazene and clonitazene. It is found in
yellow, brown or off-white powder forms.

WHO review history
Isotonitazene has not previously been formally reviewed by WHO and is not
currently under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s
attention that this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to
public health and has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Isotonitazene is a chemical analogue of etonitazene and clonitazene, both of
which are Schedule I compounds under the Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs, 1961. Isotonitazene is a potent opioid analgesic with a rapid onset
of action. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that isotonitazene is more
potent than fentanyl and hydromorphone and substantially more potent than
morphine. There is limited research on the effects of this compound on the
central nervous system, but, given its demonstrated potency at the µ-opioid
receptor, it would be expected to produce analgesia, respiratory depression
and sedation.

Dependence potential
No controlled animal or human studies have been reported of the dependence
potential of isotonitazene. As a potent µ-opioid agonist, it would be expected
to produce dependence. An unverified online report described dependent use
and withdrawal symptoms, including flu-like symptoms and anxiety.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No controlled studies have been reported on the abuse potential of
isotonitazene, but, as it is a potent µ-opioid receptor agonist, it would be
expected to produce euphoria and other effects predictive of high abuse
liability.
        Because of its relatively recent appearance on the illicit drug market, there is
limited information on the prevalence of use of isotonitazene or of its harm.
Seizures have been reported in many countries and regions. It is reported
to be used through various routes, including sublingually, vaping and
intravenously.
        The number of deaths involving isotonitazene has increased in a short time.
Deaths commonly occur after use in combination with other opioids or
benzodiazepines. Deaths due to isotonitazene share features with deaths
due to heroin, including evidence of injection and signs consistent with
opioid overdose, such as pulmonary and/or cerebral oedema. Deaths due
to isotonitazene are likely to be underreported because of its recent, rapid
appearance.

Therapeutic usefulness
Isotonitazene is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
The mechanism of action of isotonitazene (chemical name: N,N-diethyl-
2-(2-(4-isopropoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)ethan-1-
amine) indicates that it is liable to have similar abuse and similar ill effects as
opioids that are controlled under Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs. Its use has been reported in a number of countries and
has been associated with adverse effects, including death. It has no known
therapeutic use and is likely to cause substantial harm.
            Recommendation: The Committee recommended that isotonitazene
(chemical name: N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-isopropoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-
benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)ethan-1-amine) be added to Schedule I of the 1961
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.

1.1 Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
1.1.1 MDMB-4en-PINACA
Substance identification
MDMB-4en-PINACA (chemical name: methyl-3,3-dimethyl-2-(1-(pent-4-
en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)butanoate) is a synthetic cannabinoid.
It has been identified in seized material formulated for smoking and found as
white to yellow–brown powder.

WHO review history
MDMB-4en-PINACA has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not
currently under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s
attention that this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to
public health and has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
MDMB-4en-PINACA is a synthetic cannabinoid that binds to cannabinoid
(CB1) receptors as a full and potent agonist. It is structurally similar to
5F-MDMB-PINACA (5F-ADB), which is controlled under Schedule II of the
Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.
A report of an unpublished study in animals indicates that MDMB-
4en-PINACA can have the characteristic effects of CB1 agonists, such as
hypothermia and lethargy.
Reports on online user forums describe cannabis-like euphoria at moderate
levels of intake, with dissociation described at higher doses. Both sedation and
stimulation have been reported, in addition to memory loss, confusion and
agitation.

Dependence potential
No studies have been reported in animals or humans on the dependence
potential of MDMB-4en-PINACA. As it is a full CB1 agonist, it would be
expected to produce dependence similarly to other CB1 receptor agonists.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No studies have been reported in animals or humans to indicate the likelihood
of abuse of MDMB-4en-PINACA; however, CB1 receptor agonists have known
abuse potential.
A number of countries in various regions have reported use of MDMB-4en-
PINACA.
Its use has been associated with cases of impaired driving and death.

Therapeutic usefulness
MDMB-4en-PINACA has no known therapeutic use.

Recommendation
MDMB-4en-PINACA (chemical name: methyl-3,3-dimethyl-2-(1-(pent-
4-en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)butanoate) is a potent synthetic
cannabinoid receptor agonist with a similar mechanism of action and similar
effects to a number of other synthetic cannabinoids that are controlled under
Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. Use
of MDMB-4en-PINACA has been associated with severe adverse effects,
including fatal intoxication and cases of impaired driving. MDMB-4en-
PINACA has no therapeutic use.
       Recommendation: The Committee recommended that MDMB-4en-PINACA
(chemical name: methyl (S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-(1-(pent-4-en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-
3-carboxamido)butanoate) be added to Schedule II of the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971.

1.1.1 CUMYL-PEGACLONE
Substance identification
CUMYL‐PEGACLONE (chemical name: 5-pentyl-2-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)-
2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one) is a synthetic cannabinoid. It has
been found in seized material formulated for smoking and vaping.

WHO review history
CUMYL-PEGACLONE has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not
currently under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s
attention that this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to
public health and has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
CUMYL-PEGACLONE is a synthetic cannabinoid with a mechanism of
action similar to that of other synthetic cannabinoids. It is a potent full agonist
at CB1 receptors.
No controlled studies have been reported of its effects, but online user reports
describe euphoria, dissociation, red eyes, dry mouth and appetite stimulation.
These effects are consistent with the known effects of cannabinoid agonists.

Dependence potential
No controlled studies have been reported in animals or humans on the
dependence potential of CUMYL-PEGACLONE. However, CUMYL-
PEGACLONE has been shown to be a full, potent agonist at the CB1 receptor
and would therefore be expected to produce dependence similarly to other
CB1 receptor agonists.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No controlled animal or human studies have been reported on the abuse
potential of CUMYL-PEGACLONE.
A number of countries in several regions have reported that CUMYL-
PEGACLONE is being used for its psychoactive properties.
Adverse effects such as seizures and fatalities involving CUMYL-
PEGACLONE have been reported. While other drugs were also used,
CUMYL-PEGACLONE was deemed to be a causal or contributory factor in a
number of these deaths.

Therapeutic usefulness
CUMYL-PEGACLONE is not known to have any therapeutic use.

Recommendation
CUMYL‐PEGACLONE (chemical name: 5-pentyl-2-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)-
2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one) is a synthetic cannabinoid receptor
agonist with a mode of action that suggests the likelihood of dependence and
abuse and ill effects similar to those of other synthetic cannabinoids. Its use
has been associated with severe adverse effects and fatalities. The effects of
CUMYL‐PEGACLONE are similar to those of other synthetic cannabinoids
that are controlled under Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic
Substances of 1971. CUMYL‐PEGACLONE has no therapeutic use, and its
use constitutes a substantial risk to public health.
    Recommendation: The Committee recommended that CUMYL‐
PEGACLONE (Chemical(chemical name: 5-pentyl-2-(2-phenylpropan-2-
yl)- 2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one), be added to Schedule II of the
Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.

1.1 Benzodiazepines
1.1.1 Flubromazolam
Substance identification
Flubromazolam (chemical name: 8-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-
benzo[f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine ) is a 1-4 triazolobenzodiazepine.
Flubromazolam is a white powder, often sold as a liquid or as tablets.

WHO review history
Flubromazolam has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not currently
under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s attention that
this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to public health and
has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Flubromazolam is a highly potent benzodiazepine with long-lasting
depressant effects on the central nervous system. Flubromazolam enhances
the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by
binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. This mechanism
of action, and its effects, are similar to those of the benzodiazepines triazolam
and alprazolam, which are controlled under Schedule IV of the 1971
Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
A single pharmacokinetics study showed that a dose of 0.5 mg flubromazolam
induced strong sedative effects that lasted more than 10 h and caused
partial amnesia for more than 24 h. The effects of flubromazolam have been
effectively reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.
Reports on online user forums describe benzodiazepine-like effects, including
anxiolytic, euphoric and sedative effects.

Dependence potential
No controlled studies have been reported in animals or humans on the
dependence potential of flubromazolam, although many online reports
describe severe withdrawal symptoms, such as muscle aches, sleeping
disorders, severe anxiety and panic attacks, dissociative symptoms, perceptual
distortions, cramping, chills, vomiting and risk of seizures. Loss of control of
use and rapid onset of tolerance have also been described. The latter suggest
that increased dosing and physical dependence are likely.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No controlled animal or human studies have assessed the abuse potential of
flubromazolam.
Impaired driving has been reported with flubromazolam as the sole
intoxicant. Non-fatal intoxications requiring hospital admission and fatal
intoxications due to flubromazolam use have been documented, with
central nervous system depression and severe sedation as clinical features of
presentation. Flubromazolam can increase unintentional opioid overdoses. Its
long half-life may increase the risk of accumulation and of interactions when
taken with other drugs.
Nonmedical use and seizures due to flubromazolam have been documented
in many countries in various regions. It is increasingly sold as falsified
pharmaceutical benzodiazepines.

Therapeutic usefulness
Flubromazolam is not known to have any therapeutic use, is not on the WHO
Model List of Essential Medicines and has never been marketed as a medicinal
product.

Recommendation
Flubromazolam (chemical name: 8-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-
benzo[f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine ) is a 1-4 triazolobenzodiazepine
with actions and effects very similar to those of benzodiazepines listed under
Schedule IV in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. It can
produce a state of dependence and central nervous system depression, like
other benzodiazepines. Reports of abuse, impaired driving and fatal and
non-fatal intoxications have been increasing. There is sufficient evidence of its
abuse to conclude that it constitutes a significant risk to public health; it has
no known therapeutic use.
   Recommendation: The Committee recommended that flubromazolam
(chemical name: 8-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-benzo[f]
[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3- a][1,4]diazepine) be added to Schedule IV of the 1971
Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

1.1.1 Clonazolam
Substance identification
Clonazolam (chemical name: 6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-8-nitro-4H-
benzo[f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3- a][1,4]diazepine) is a 1-4 triazolobenzodiazepine
similar to clonazepam, triazolam and alprazolam. It is sold in powder, blotter,
liquid and tablet forms.

WHO review history
Clonazolam has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not currently
under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s attention that
this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to public health and
has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Clonazolam enhances the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by
binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. This mechanism
of action and its effects (sedation, muscle relaxation, slurred speech, loss
of motor control, amnesia) are similar to those of benzodiazepines such as
diazepam, triazolam and alprazolam, which are controlled under Schedule IV
of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
   The effects of clonazolam poisoning have been reversed with the
benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, confirming that its action is mediated
via the benzodiazepine receptor in the GABAA receptor complex.

Dependence potential
No controlled studies have been reported in animals or humans on the
dependence potential of clonazolam, although its pharmacological effects and
its similarity to other benzodiazepines indicate that it would be expected to
produce dependence.
        Development of tolerance to the effects of clonazolam after repeated use and
the onset of withdrawal symptoms after cessation of use have been reported
on online forums.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No studies in humans or animals have examined the abuse liability of
clonazolam. Online forums describe its recreational use and consistently
report strong anxiolytic effects.
A number of published reports describe the management of cases of
intoxication involving clonazolam in emergency departments or intensive
care. Use of clonazolam has been confirmed analytically in cases of impaired
driving, in combination with other substances. Clonazolam can increase the
effects of other drugs, including opioids, and on its own can cause severe
central nervous system depression, including somnolence, confusion, sedation
and unconsciousness.
    Its identification has been reported in many countries in all regions, indicating
that its use may be increasing. Clonazolam is increasingly sold as falsified
pharmaceutical benzodiazepines.

Therapeutic usefulness
Clonazolam is not known to have any therapeutic use, is not on the WHO
Model List of Essential Medicines and has never been marketed as a medicinal
product.

Recommendation
Clonazolam (chemical name: 6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-8-nitro-4H-
benzo[f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3- a][1,4]diazepine) is a 1-4 triazolobenzodiazepine
with actions and effects very similar to those of benzodiazepines listed under
Schedule IV in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. Like
other benzodiazepines, clonazolam can produce a state of dependence and
central nervous system depression. There have been a number of reports
of abuse, impaired driving and non-fatal intoxications. There is sufficient
evidence of its abuse to constitute a public health problem, and it has no
known therapeutic use.
      Recommendation: The Committee recommend that clonazolam (chemical
name: 6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-8-nitro-4H-benzo[f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-
a][1,4]diazepine) be added to Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on
Psychotropic Substances.

1.1.1 Diclazepam
Substance identification
Diclazepam (chemical name: 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-
dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2-one) is a 2-chloro derivative of the
benzodiazepine diazepam. It is found as a white powder, and is commonly
sold as tablets, pellets and liquid.

WHO review history
Diclazepam has not been formally reviewed by WHO and is not currently
under international control. Information was brought to WHO’s attention that
this substance is manufactured clandestinely, poses a risk to public health and
has no recognized therapeutic use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Diclazepam is an agonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor,
acting to increase the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.
Diclazepam has effects similar to those of the benzodiazepine diazepam,
which is currently controlled under the Convention on Psychotropic
Substances of 1971. It is metabolized to the benzodiazepines delorazepam,
lorazepam and lormetazepam, which are active and are also pharmaceuticals
included in Schedule IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of
1971.
        Diclazepam was shown to cause sedation and muscle relaxation in animals.
Central nervous system depressant effects have been described in humans.

Dependence potential
No controlled studies have been reported in animals or humans on the
dependence potential of diclazepam.
Online user reports describe cross-tolerance with other benzodiazepines
and use to self-manage benzodiazepine withdrawal. This evidence and its
mechanism of action suggest that diclazepam can produce dependence, like
other benzodiazepines.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No controlled studies in animals or humans have been reported on the abuse
liability of diclazepam. On the basis of its mechanism of action and its effects,
however, its abuse liability would be expected to be similar to that of other
benzodiazepines.
        Diclazepam has the potential to increase unintentional opioid overdoses. Its
long half-life may increase the risk of accumulation and of interactions when
combined with other drugs. Fatal intoxication with diclazepam has been
reported.
        Seizures have been reported with diclazepam in many countries in various
regions. Diclazepam is increasingly being sold as falsified benzodiazepines,
commonly as diazepam.
         Diclazepam has been implicated in cases of impaired driving, including when
it was identified as the main contributor to impairment. It also has been
involved in cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault.

Therapeutic usefulness
Diclazepam is not known to have any therapeutic use, is not on the WHO
Model List of Essential Medicines and has never been marketed as a medicinal
product.

Recommendation
Diclazepam (chemical name: 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-
dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2-one) is a 2-chloro analogue of the
benzodiazepine diazepam, with actions and effects very similar to those of
benzodiazepines listed under Schedule IV of the Convention on Psychotropic
Substances of 1971. It can produce a state of dependence and central nervous
system depression, like other benzodiazepines. There have been reports of
abuse, impaired driving and fatal and nonfatal intoxications. There is sufficient
evidence of its abuse to conclude that it constitutes a significant risk to public
health; it has no known therapeutic use.
        Recommendation: The Committee recommended that diclazepam (chemical
name: 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-
benzodiazepin-2-one) be added to Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on
Psychotropic Substances.
