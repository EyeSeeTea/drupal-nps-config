9.3.1       N-Benzylpiperazine (BZP)
Substance identification
N-benzylpiperazine (BZP) is an aryl-substituted piperazine and is chemically
1-benzyl-1,4-diazacyclohexane.

Previous review
BZP was pre-reviewed at the thirty-fifth meeting of the ECDD and based on
the reported psychostimulant effects, evidence of abuse and adverse effects, the
Expert Committee had concluded that a critical review was warranted.
Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
BZP stimulates the release and inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin (5-
HT) and noradrenaline, but dopaminergic and serotonergic effects predominate.
It is a central nervous system stimulant with amphetamine-like properties
demonstrated in both animal and human studies, although with a psychostimulant
response potency less than that of dexamfetamine (INN). Like amphetamine,
in humans, BZP was found to increase pulse rate, blood pressure (systolic and
diastolic) and pupillary dilation. Adverse effects may occur when BZP is co-
ingested with other drugs (in particular 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA) and other serotonergic/dopaminergic compounds), but toxic effects
associated with BZP alone have also been reported. Agitation, tachycardia and
seizures have been noted.

Dependence potential
There have been few studies on the dependence potential of BZP and no specific
studies have been done in humans. However, a study involving the administration
of BZP to people who had been dependent on amphetamine and similar drugs
suggested that BZP is liable to abuse. Animal studies found that BZP possessed
rewarding properties and reinforcing effects, and substituted for cocaine,
amphetamine and S(+)-MDMA in self-administration and discrimination
studies.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
BZP abuse and/or seized material has been reported in 18 countries. BZP use
appears to be associated with situations similar to that of “ecstasy” (MDMA), or
with users who are seeking effects similar to those obtained with ecstasy. BZP has
previously been sold as “ecstasy” in powder, capsule, tablet or pellet form via the
Internet.

Therapeutic usefulness
BZP has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use. However, it was
synthesized in the early 1940s and it is often reported that BZP was originally
developed as a potential anthelminthic for the treatment of intestinal parasitic
worms in livestock, but was not licensed as it was found to be relatively ineffective
and to cause adverse effects such as seizures in mammals. However, no published
or unpublished works confirm these accounts. In the 1980s, BZP was used
to manufacture the antidepressant medication piberaline, which was later
withdrawn.

Recommendation
BZP has been shown to have effects similar to amphetamine. The Committee
considered that the degree of risk to public health and society associated with the
abuse liability of BZP is substantial. Its therapeutic usefulness has been assessed
to be little, as it is not currently licensed for use. The Committee considered that
the evidence of its abuse warranted its placement under international control.
The Committee recommended that BZP be placed in Schedule II of the 1971
Convention.

9.3.2     Tapentadol (INN)
Substance identification
Tapentadol is chemically 3-[(1R,2R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl]-
phenol hydrochloride. It has two chiral centres and is manufactured as a single
(R,R)-stereoisomer.

Previous review
Tapentadol was pre-reviewed during the thirty-fifth meeting of ECDD and a
recommendation was made for critical review.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Tapentadol has some structural similarity to morphine and has shown agonist
activity at the μ-opioid receptor and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. It
produces analgesia in acute and chronic pain states similar to that produced by
oxycodone or morphine. Most reports of adverse events in humans have come
from clinical trials, with nausea, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence and headache
being the most commonly reported by patients. Respiratory depression with
tapentadol has occurred rarely and had limited clinical relevance.

Dependence potential
Few published preclinical data on dependence potential for tapentadol exist,
but animal studies have shown that tolerance and dependence developed in
rats. There was a small amount of evidence of withdrawal in clinical studies in
humans. Patients taking tapentadol were less likely to have withdrawal symptoms
as assessed using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale than subjects taking
oxycodone.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Based on the preclinical and clinical pharmacology of tapentadol, as well as
anecdotal data, the potential for abuse with tapentadol is consistent with that of
currently marketed drugs such as hydromorphone, oxycodone, morphine, and
tramadol. Tapentadol has been marketed since 2008 without significant events or
signs of abuse and currently is dispensed with tamper-resistant coatings. However,
tapentadol has not yet appeared in many drug use surveys or surveillance
reports, which limits the data regarding tapentadol abuse, dependence, diversion,
recreational use, or poison control. Those data that are available suggest the
potential for abuse of tapentadol to be similar to that of other μ-opioid agonists
or slightly less. While three respondents to the WHO questionnaire confirmed
recreational/harmful use of tapentadol, thirteen stated that there was no such
use.

Therapeutic usefulness
Tapentadol is primarily prescribed and dispensed on an outpatient basis for
osteoarthritis, joint pain or chronic pain states that have not responded to other
medications.

Recommendation
Owing to the current insufficiency of data regarding dependence, abuse and risks
to public health (including risks to the individual), the Committee recommended
that tapentadol not be placed under international control at this time but be kept
under surveillance.

9.3.3     Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)
Substance identification
Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) is chemically oxolan-2-one. GBL can be synthesized
from ɤ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) or tetrahydrofuran.

Previous review
During the pre-review of GHB at the thirty-fourth meeting of the ECDD, the
Committee “noted information relating to the abuse of GBL itself (convertible
to GHB in the body) and suggested this substance for pre-review”. Based on the
evidence presented in the pre-review of GBL during the thirty-fifth meeting of
the ECDD, given its close association with GHB, and the recommendation made
by the Committee at its thirty-fifth meeting to reschedule GHB from Schedule
IV to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention, the Committee recommended that a
critical review of GBL be undertaken.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
GBL is readily converted, both chemically and in the body, to the Schedule II drug
GHB and most of GBL’s pharmacological and toxicological effects are mediated
through GHB as a metabolite. Nevertheless, pharmacological factors show that
GBL tends to be more potent, faster acting and to have a longer duration of
activity than GHB. It is a central nervous system depressant with effects that are
exacerbated by other central nervous system depressants (including ethanol).
There is a steep dose–effect curve between doses producing desired and excessive
effects, and there have been numerous published reports of adverse reactions
to GBL including fatalities. Signs and symptoms include euphoria, relaxation,
reduced inhibition and sedation, progressing to vomiting, urinary and faecal
incontinence, agitation, convulsions, bradycardia, respiratory depression, coma
and death.

Dependence potential
Reports of animal studies noted a spontaneous and precipitated withdrawal
syndrome after chronic administration of GBL. There have been various reports
that, in human users, GBL can produce a withdrawal syndrome when the
substance is abruptly discontinued following regular chronic use. Withdrawal
from GBL appears similar to withdrawal from other sedative–hypnotic drugs
such as ethanol and benzodiazepines.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
GBL abuse and/or seized material have been reported in 18 countries. GBL is
sold as a liquid, often presented for illicit sale as GHB but also as a so-called
cleaning product via the Internet. It is extremely difficult to accurately assess the
magnitude of abuse relating specifically to GBL considering the near absence of
data explicitly pertaining to GBL rather than GHB or 1,4-butanediol.

Therapeutic usefulness
While GBL was sold in health food shops and athletic venues as a dietary
supplement and purported to induce sleep, release growth hormone, enhance
sexual activity and athletic performance, there is no recognized therapeutic
indication for GBL. However, it has widespread industrial use being a common
solvent found in paint strippers, nail polish removers, stain removers and circuit
board cleaners. It is also a common intermediate in industrial chemistry including
in the manufacture of pyrrolidones and in some pharmaceuticals.

Recommendation
GBL produces its effects in the body through the in vivo formation of the
scheduled substance GHB. The Committee considered that the degree of risk to
public health and society associated with the abuse liability of GBL is especially
serious. While the Committee recognized widespread and important industrial
use, GBL has no defined therapeutic usefulness. The Committee considered that
the evidence of its abuse warranted its placement under international control
within Schedule I of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.4     1,4-Butanediol (1,4-BD)
Substance identification
1,4-butanediol (butane-1,4-diol; 1,4-BDO or 1,4-BD) is a colourless, viscous
liquid derived from butane by placement of alcohol groups at each end of the
chain. It is one of four stable isomers of butanediol.

Previous review
During the discussion of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) at its thirty-fourth
meeting, the ECDD “noted information relating to the abuse of 1,4-BD itself
(convertible to GHB in the body) and suggested this substance for pre-review.”
Based on the evidence presented in the pre-review of GBL during its thirty-fifth
meeting, given its close association with GHB, and the recommendation made
by the Committee to reschedule GHB from Schedule IV to Schedule II of the
1971 Convention, the thirty-fifth meeting of the Committee recommended that
a critical review of 1,4-BD be undertaken.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
1,4-BD is readily converted, both chemically and in the body, to the Schedule
II drug, GHB, with a Tmax of conversion following oral administration of 39.4
(± 11.2) minutes in humans. Most of 1,4-BD’s pharmacological and toxicological
effects are mediated through GHB as a metabolite, as 1,4-BD itself has no binding
affinity to central nervous system receptors. Nevertheless, through GHB, it
produces central nervous system depressant effects which may be exacerbated
by other central nervous system depressants (including ethanol). There is a
steep dose–effect curve between doses producing desired and excessive effects,
and there have been various published reports of adverse reactions to 1,4-BD
including fatalities. Signs and symptoms include euphoria, relaxation, reduced
inhibition and sedation, progressing to vomiting, urinary and faecal incontinence,
agitation, convulsions, bradycardia, respiratory depression, coma and death.

Dependence potential
Some animal studies have indicated that 1,4-BD can induce physical dependence.
There have been various reports that, in human users, 1,4-BD can produce a
withdrawal syndrome when the substance is abruptly discontinued following
regular chronic use. Withdrawal from 1,4 BD appears similar to withdrawal from
other sedative–hypnotic drugs such as ethanol and benzodiazepines.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
1,4-BD abuse and/or seized material has been reported in 18 countries. There are
instances of diversion of the raw substance, and trafficking in dietary supplements
containing the compound as well as discrete instances of clandestine manufacture.
1,4-BD is sold under various product and so-called street names. It is extremely
difficult to accurately assess the magnitude of abuse relating specifically to 1,4-
BD considering the near absence of data explicitly pertaining to 1,4-BD rather
than GHB or GBL.

Therapeutic usefulness
1,4-BD has no recognized therapeutic application. However, the dimethanesulfonate
form (1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate) is available in oral and intravenous
formulations for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia but does not
produce any adverse effects on the central nervous system. However, 1,4-BD has
industrial use as an intermediate chemical for production of tetrahydrofuran and
poly(tetramethylene-ether)glycol, polybutylene terephthalate, GBL, polyurethane
and other solvents.

Recommendation
1,4-Butanediol produces its effects in the body through the in vivo formation of
the scheduled substance GHB. The Committee considered that the degree of risk
to public health and society associated with the abuse liability of 1,4-butanediol
is especially serious. While the Committee recognized its widespread and
important industrial use, 1,4-butanediol has no defined therapeutic usefulness.
The Committee considered that the evidence of its abuse warranted its placement
under international control within Schedule I of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.5     JWH-018
Substance identification
Naphthalen-1-yl(1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)methanone, is also referred to as JWH-
018.

Previous review
JWH-018 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by
the Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information
brought to WHO’s attention that JWH-018 is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
The aminoalkylindole JWH-018 is a full cannabinoid agonist with low
nanomolar binding affinity at cannabinoid receptors type 1 and type 2 (CB1 and
CB2 receptors). It also appears that some slight selectivity is observed towards
the CB2 receptor. Its interaction with these receptor subtypes correlates with a
psychopharmacological profile that is shared with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), which is less potent in a number of assays than JWH-018. Analytically
confirmed cases of adverse effects, including non-fatal and fatal intoxications,
have been reported in addition to instances of driving under the influence of the
substance. Seizures, tachycardia and hypertension have been noted.

Dependence potential
There is some evidence to suggest that synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
may be able to produce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when substance use
is abruptly discontinued following regular use of high doses. Further detailed
studies of these properties of JWH-018 are warranted. The urge for re-dosing has
also been associated with JWH-018.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Reports obtained from animal studies (e.g. drug discrimination) indicate the
ability of JWH-018 to mimic effects typically observed with THC. Survey data
indicate that JWH-018, like a range of other synthetic cannabinoids, shows THC-
like effects in humans. In a WHO survey, 25 Member States confirmed that there
was recreational/harmful use of JWH-018.

Therapeutic usefulness
JWH-018 has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use. Within
the research setting, anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties of
JWH-018 have been reported.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base concerning
the substance. It also noted analytically confirmed cases of non-fatal and fatal
intoxications involving JWH-018. The Committee therefore considered that the
degree of risk to public health associated with the abuse liability of JWH-018 is
substantial. Therapeutic usefulness has not been recorded. As per the Guidance
on the WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control (4), higher
regard was accorded to the substantial public health risk than to the lack of
therapeutic usefulness.1 The Committee recommended that JWH-018 be placed
under international control in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.6       JWH-073
Substance identification
(1-butyl-1H-indol-3-yl)(naphthalen-1-yl)methanone, also referred to as JWH-
073.

Previous review
JWH-073 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed. A direct
critical review was proposed based on information brought to WHO’s attention
that JWH-073 is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially serious risk to
public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use by any party.
Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different countries
indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it has no
medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
The aminoalkylindole JWH-073 shows agonist properties at CB1 and CB2
receptors and appears to be equipotent to delta-9-THC. Its interaction with these
receptor subtypes correlates with a psychopharmacological profile that is shared
with delta-9-THC, although it appears to be shorter acting than the natural
product. While there were analytically confirmed cases of non-fatal intoxications
(tachycardia and hypertension were noted), these also involved other confirmed
synthetic cannabinoids.

Dependence potential
There is some evidence to suggest that synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
may be able to produce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when substance use
is abruptly discontinued following regular use of high doses. Further detailed
studies on these properties of JWH-073 are warranted.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Reports obtained from animal studies (e.g. drug discrimination) indicate the
ability of JWH-073 to mimic effects typically observed with THC. Survey data
indicate that JWH-073, like a range of other synthetic cannabinoids, shows THC-
like effects in humans. In a WHO survey, 22 Member States confirmed that there
was recreational/harmful use of JWH-073.

Therapeutic usefulness
JWH-073 has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base
concerning the substance. Of particular significance was the lack of analytically
confirmed cases of non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving solely JWH-073.
The Committee recommended that JWH-073 not be placed under international
control at this time, but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.7     AM-2201
Substance identification
AM-2201 is chemically [1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-naphthalen-1-yl-
methanone.

Previous review
AM-2201 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed. A direct
critical review was proposed based on information brought to WHO’s attention
that AM-2201 is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially serious risk to
public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use by any party.
Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different countries
indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it has no
medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
AM-2201 (the 5-fluoropentyl analogue of JWH-018) is a full cannabinoid agonist
with low nanomolar binding affinity at the CB1 receptor. Its interaction with
these receptor subtypes correlates with a psychopharmacological profile that is
shared with delta-9-THC. It appears to display a greater potency in vitro than
JWH-018. Analytically confirmed cases of adverse effects, including non-fatal
and fatal occurrences, have been reported in addition to instances of driving
under the influence of the drug. Restlessness, hallucinations and somnolence
have been noted.

Dependence potential
There is some evidence to suggest that synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
may be able to produce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when substance use
is abruptly discontinued following regular use of high doses. Further detailed
studies on these properties of AM 2201 are warranted.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Survey data indicate that AM-2201, like a range of other synthetic cannabinoids,
shows THC-like effects in humans. In a WHO survey, 22 Member States
confirmed that there was recreational/harmful use of AM-2201.

Therapeutic usefulness
AM-2201 has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base
concerning the substance. It also noted analytically confirmed cases of non-fatal
and fatal intoxications involving AM-2201. The Committee therefore considered
that the degree of risk to public health associated with the abuse liability of AM-
2201 is substantial. Therapeutic usefulness has not been recorded. As per the
Guidance on the WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control
(4), higher regard was accorded to the substantial public health risk than to the
lack of therapeutic usefulness.1 The Committee recommended that AM-2201 be
placed under international control in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.8       UR-144
Substance identification
UR-144 is chemically: (1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)
methanone.

Previous review
UR-144 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information
brought to WHO’s attention that UR-144 is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
UR-144 shows high affinity and selectivity towards the CB2 receptor and shows
cannabinoid agonist properties at both CB1 and CB2 receptor subtypes. While
there were analytically confirmed cases of non-fatal (nausea, vomiting, seizures
and tachycardia) and fatal intoxications these also involved other confirmed
synthetic cannabinoids. Detections of UR-144 in instances of driving under the
influence of the drug were also reported.

Dependence potential
There is some evidence to suggest that synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
may be able to produce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when substance use
is abruptly discontinued following regular use of high doses. Further detailed
studies on these properties of UR-144 are warranted.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Survey data indicate that UR-144, like a range of other synthetic cannabinoids,
shows THC-like effects in humans. In a WHO survey, 19 Member States
confirmed that there was recreational/harmful use of UR-144.

Therapeutic usefulness
UR-144 has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base concerning
the substance. Of particular significance was the lack of analytically confirmed
cases of non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving solely UR-144. The Committee
recommended that UR-144 not be placed under international control at this time
but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.9    APINACA (AKB-48)
Substance identification
APINACA (AKB-48) is chemically N-(adamantan-1-yl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-
3-carboxamide.

Previous review
APINACA had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that APINACA is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
APINACA binds to CB1 and CB2 receptors with twofold higher affinity for
the CB2-subtype. However, the binding affinity of APINACA to both receptor
subtypes is at least 15-fold lower than that of delta-9-THC.

Dependence potential
There is some evidence to suggest that synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
may be able to produce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when substance use
is abruptly discontinued following regular use of high doses. Further detailed
studies on these properties of APINACA are warranted.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Survey data indicate that APINACA, like a range of other synthetic cannabinoids,
shows THC-like effects in humans. In a WHO survey, 16 Member States
confirmed that there was recreational/harmful use of APINACA.

Therapeutic usefulness
APINACA has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base concerning
the substance. Of particular significance was the lack of analytically confirmed
cases of non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving APINACA. The Committee
recommended that APINACA not be placed under international control at this
time but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.10 RCS-4
Substance identification
RCS-4 is chemically 4-methoxyphenyl(1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)methanone.

Previous review
RCS-4 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that RCS-4 is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially
serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use
by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different
countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it
has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
The affinity of RCS-4 for CB1 and CB2 receptors is not known, but RCS-4 is able to
stimulate guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding to rat brain cortical membranes
in a specific CB1 receptor-mediated binding assay. Thus it is conceivable that
its effects may show delta-9-THC-like features. While there were analytically
confirmed cases of non-fatal intoxications, these also involved other confirmed
synthetic cannabinoids. Detections of RCS-4 in instances of driving under the
influence of the drug were also reported.

Dependence potential
There is some evidence to suggest that synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists
may be able to produce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when substance use
is abruptly discontinued following regular use of high doses. Further detailed
studies on these properties of RCS-4 are warranted.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Survey data indicate that RCS-4, like a range of other synthetic cannabinoids,
shows THC-like effects in humans. In a WHO survey, 19 Member States
confirmed that there was recreational/harmful use of RCS-4.

Therapeutic usefulness
RCS-4 has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base concerning
the substance. Of particular significance was the lack of analytically confirmed
cases of non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving RCS-4. The Committee
recommended that RCS-4 not be placed under international control at this time
but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.11 JWH-250
Substance identification
JWH-250 is chemically 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-(1-pentylindol-3-yl)ethanone.

Previous review
JWH-250 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed. A direct
critical review was proposed based on information brought to WHO’s attention
that JWH-250 is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially serious risk to
public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use by any party.
Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different countries
indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it has no
medical use.

9.3.12 Mephedrone
Substance identification
Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone, 4-MMC) is chemically (R,S)-2-(methyl-
amino)-1-(4-methylphenyl)propan-1-one.

Previous review
Mephedrone had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that mephedrone is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial
harm. Furthermore, a notification to the Secretary-General had been made
by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning
a proposed recommendation for international control of mephedrone
(4-methylmethcathinone), under Article 2, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Convention
on Psychotropic Substances, 1971.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Mephedrone is a ring-substituted analogue of methcathinone. Key features
related to the mechanisms of action are comparable with psychostimulants
and medicinal products that target the monoaminergic system. In vitro studies
indicate that mephedrone may act as a non-selective substrate at transporters
of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, similar to MDMA. Although
its catecholamine-related properties appear to be less pronounced than those
observed with methamphetamine, the behavioural profile of mephedrone was
observed overall to be comparable with amphetamine-type psychostimulants.
Mephedrone appears to show a profile with abuse liability. Adverse effects
reported in connection with mephedrone use pointed towards the observation
of a psychostimulant-type toxidrome and include tachycardia, hypertension,
agitation, paranoia, hallucinations and insomnia. Non-fatal and fatal intoxications
involving mephedrone have been reported.

Dependence potential
No detailed clinical studies in humans are available. Reports obtained from surveys
and casework indicated that mephedrone consumption might be associated with
the potential to produce cravings and dependence. Further studies are warranted
to elucidate the psychological or physical mechanisms of dependence.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Self-administration studies in animals indicated a propensity for self-
administration and abuse liability. In humans, mephedrone use was reported to
show psychostimulant-like effects and an association with binge use (i.e. repeated
use of the drug within a short period of time) was noted. In a WHO survey, 21
Member States confirmed recreational/harmful use of mephedrone.

Therapeutic usefulness
Mephedrone has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society
associated with the abuse liability of mephedrone is substantial. Therapeutic
usefulness has not been recorded. The Committee considered that the evidence
of its abuse warranted its placement under international control. As per the
Guidance on the WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control
(4), higher regard was accorded to the substantial public health risk than to the
lack of therapeutic usefulness.1 The Committee recommended that mephedrone
be placed in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.13 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV)
Substance identification
3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is chemically (R,S)-1-(1,3-benzo
-dioxol-5-yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one.

Previous review
MDPV had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that MDPV is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially
serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use
by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different
countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it
has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
MDPV is structurally related to pyrovalerone. Key features related to the
mechanisms of action are comparable with cocaine-like psychostimulants, which
includes potent dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter
(NET) selective transporter blockage. MDPV is a potent locomotor stimulant in
mice, which has also been shown to lead to increases of extracellular dopamine
in mesolimbic reward pathways using microdialysis studies. MDPV appears
to show a profile of high abuse liability. Adverse effects reported from MDPV
use pointed towards the observation of a potent and potentially long-lasting
psychostimulant-type toxidrome and include severe agitation, violent behaviour,
tachycardia, psychosis, profuse diaphoresis, paranoia and anxiety. Non-fatal and
fatal intoxications involving MDPV have been reported.

Dependence potential
No detailed clinical studies in humans are available. Reports obtained from
surveys and casework indicated that MDPV consumption might be associated
with the potential to produce craving and dependence. Further studies are
warranted to elucidate the psychological or physical mechanisms of dependence.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Self-administration studies in animals indicated a strong propensity for self-
administration and abuse liability. In humans, MDPV use was reported to
show potent psychostimulant-like effects and a strong association with binge
use. In a WHO survey, 22 Member States confirmed recreational/harmful use
of MDPV. MDPV might show abuse liability similar to that of cocaine and
methamphetamine, especially in experienced recreational drug users with a
history of poly-drug use.

Therapeutic usefulness
MDPV has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society
associated with the abuse liability of MDPV is substantial. Therapeutic usefulness
has not been recorded. The Committee considered that the evidence of its abuse
warranted its placement under international control. As per the Guidance on the
WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control (4), higher regard
was accorded to the substantial public health risk than to the lack of therapeutic
usefulness.1 The Committee recommended that MDPV be placed in Schedule II
of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.14 Methylone (BK-MDMA)
Substance identification
Methylone(beta-keto-MDMA) is chemically (R,S)-1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-
2-(methylamino)propan-1-one.

Previous review
Methylone had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by
the Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information
brought to WHO’s attention that methylone is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Methylone is the beta-keto analogue of MDMA. Key features related to the
mechanisms of action are comparable with psychostimulants and medicinal
products that target the monoaminergic system. Some of its pharmacological
properties overlap with those reported for mephedrone. These include the ability
to act as a non-selective substrate at transporters of serotonin, dopamine and
norepinephrine. Although its catecholamine-related properties appear to be
less pronounced than those observed with methamphetamine, the behavioural
profile of methylone was observed to be similar to that of amphetamine-type
psychostimulants. Methylone shows potential for abuse liability. Adverse effects
reported in connection with methylone use pointed towards the observation
of a psychostimulant-type toxidrome and include tachycardia, hypertension,
paranoia, anxiety, bruxism and muscle tension and aching. Non-fatal and fatal
intoxications involving methylone have been reported.

Dependence potential
No detailed clinical studies in humans are available.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Patterns of self-administration in animals and effects on brain reward function
suggest that methylone shows potential for abuse liability. In a WHO survey, 23
Member States confirmed recreational/harmful use of methylone.

Therapeutic usefulness
Methylone has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
The Committee considered that the degree of risk to public health and society
associated with the abuse liability of methylone is substantial. Therapeutic
usefulness has not been recorded. The Committee considered that the evidence
of its abuse warranted its placement under international control. As per the
Guidance on the WHO review of psychoactive substances for international control
(4), higher regard was accorded to the substantial public health risk than to the
lack of therapeutic usefulness.1 The Committee recommended that methylone be
placed in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.15 4-Methylethcathinone (4-MEC)
Substance identification
4-Methylethcathinone (4-MEC) is chemically (R,S)-2-(ethylamino)-1-(p-tolyl)
propan-1-one.

Previous review
4-MEC had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that 4-MEC is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially
serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use
by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different
countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it
has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
4-MEC is a homologue of mephedrone. Key features related to the mechanisms of
action are comparable with psychostimulants and medicinal products that target
the monoaminergic system. Recent studies have shown that 4-MEC may act as a
non-selective inhibitor of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporters.
In addition, it was observed to selectively release serotonin, while locomotor
activity in the rat was not observed. Detailed data on adverse effects reported in
connection with 4-MEC use are not abundant, but there is some likelihood of
encountering a psychostimulant-type toxidrome. However, few non-fatal or fatal
intoxications involving 4-MEC have been reported in the literature.

Dependence potential
No detailed clinical studies in humans are available.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No detailed studies are available. In a WHO survey, 19 Member States confirmed
recreational/harmful use of 4-MEC.

Therapeutic usefulness
4-MEC has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
Owing to the current insufficiency of data regarding dependence, abuse and risks
to public health, the Committee recommended that 4-MEC not be placed under
international control at this time but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.16 4-Fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone; 4-FMC)
Substance identification
4-Fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone; 4-FMC) is chemically (R,S)-1-(4-fluoro-
phenyl)-2-methylaminopropan-1-one.

Previous review
4-FMC had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that 4-FMC is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially
serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use
by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different
countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it
has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
4-FMC is a ring-substituted analogue of methcathinone. Key features related to
the mechanisms of action are comparable with psychostimulants and medicinal
products that target the monoaminergic system. 4-FMC was observed to
function as a catecholamine-selective substrate-type releaser of dopamine
and norepinephrine. Similarities to psychomotor stimulants such as cocaine,
methcathinone and methamphetamine have been shown, although 4-FMC
appears to be less potent. Very few non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving
4-FMC have been reported in the literature.

Dependence potential
No detailed clinical studies in humans are available.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
No detailed clinical studies in humans are available. Preclinical data indicate
pharmacological overlaps with some classical psychostimulants suggesting the
possibility of abuse liability. Fifteen Member States confirmed recreational/
harmful use of 4-FMC.

Therapeutic usefulness
4-FMC has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
Owing to the current insufficiency of data regarding dependence, abuse and risks
to public health, the Committee recommended that 4-FMC not be placed under
international control at this time but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.17 25B-NBOMe
Substance identification
25B-NBOMe (2C-B-NBOMe) is chemically 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-
N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine.

Previous review
25B-NBOMe had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that 25B-NBOMe is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
25B-NBOMe is structurally related to the phenethylamine 2C-B (Schedule II
1971 Convention). It has nanomolar affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor
and is a partial agonist, with less affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor. 25B-NBOMe
is a central nervous system stimulant with hallucinogenic properties. Adverse
effects in a clinical intoxication included tachycardia, hypertension, seizures
and hyperpyrexia. Some analytically confirmed non-fatal and fatal intoxications
involving 25B-NBOMe have been reported in the literature.

Dependence potential
No studies have examined the dependence potential of 25B-NBOMe in vitro, in
animals or in humans.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
25B-NBOMe abuse and/or seized material has been reported in 10 countries. It
has been sold as a replacement for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or sold as
LSD directly on the illicit drug market, including as blotter tabs. It has also been
associated with the purchase of so-called research chemicals via the Internet.

Therapeutic usefulness
25B-NBOMe has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use. However,
radiolabelled 25B-NBOMe has been used in medical research as a tool to study
the serotonergic system in the brain and as a tracer for positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging.

Recommendation
The Committee noted the challenges associated with the evidence base
concerning the substance. The Committee considered that the degree of risk to
public health and society associated with the abuse liability of 25B-NBOMe is
especially serious. While the Committee noted its use in medical research, it has
no recorded therapeutic use. The Committee considered that the evidence of its
abuse warranted its placement under international control and recommended
that 25B-NBOMe be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.18 25C-NBOMe
Substance identification
25C-NBOMe (2C-C-NBOMe) is chemically 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-
N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine.

9.3.19 25I-NBOMe
Substance identification
25I-NBOMe (2C-I-NBOMe) is chemically 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-
[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine.

Previous review
25I-NBOMe had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that 25I-NBOMe is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.
Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
25I-NBOMe is structurally related to the phenethylamine 2C-I. It has nanomolar
affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and is a full agonist, with less affinity
for the 5-HT2C receptor. 25I-NBOMe is a central nervous system stimulant
with hallucinogenic properties. Adverse effects in clinical intoxications
included tachycardia, hypertension, confusion, agitation, aggression, visual
and auditory hallucinations, seizures, hyperpyrexia, clonus, metabolic acidosis,
rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. User injury from violent behaviour
has also been reported. Various analytically confirmed non-fatal and fatal
intoxications involving 25I-NBOMe have been reported in the literature.

Dependence potential

that 25I-NBOMe be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention.

9.3.20 Alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT)
Substance identification
Alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT) is chemically 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-methyl-
ethylamine with (R)- and (S)- stereoisomers.

Previous review
AMT had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that AMT is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially
serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use
by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different
countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it
has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
AMT shares several similarities with various scheduled tryptamine hallucino-
gens such as alpha-ethyltryptamine (AET), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT),
5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dial-
lyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-
DMT) and 5-methoxy-α-methyltryptamine (5 MeO-AMT). AMT has a high
affinity for the 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin) transporter and inhib-
its dopamine, 5 HT and norepinephrine reuptake and monoamine oxidase. It
is a central nervous system stimulant with hallucinogenic properties. Adverse
effects include mild increases in blood pressure or respiration rate, tachycardia,
mydriasis, diaphoresis, salivation, severe nausea, severe vomiting, increased deep
tendon reflexes, impaired coordination, visual and auditory disturbances and
distortions. Although fatal intoxications involving AMT have been reported in
the literature, they have also involved other drugs which may be a feature of the
toxicity profile of AMT.

Dependence potential
No studies have examined the dependence potential of AMT in vitro, in animals
or in humans.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
AMT abuse and/or seized material has been reported in nine countries. Although
the use of tryptamines (including AMT) remains limited, the use appears to have
increased over the past five years. AMT has been sold in the form of powders,
capsules or pellets via the Internet.

Therapeutic usefulness
Historically, AMT was first developed in the 1960s as an antidepressant and
monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). There is no current legitimate medical or
therapeutic use for AMT.

Recommendation
Owing to the current insufficiency of data regarding dependence, abuse and risks
to public health, the Committee recommended that AMT not be placed under
international control at this time but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.21 AH-7921
Substance identification
AH-7921 is an N-substituted cyclohexylmethylbenzamide and is chemically
3,4-dichloro-N-{[1-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]methyl}benzamide.

Previous review
AH-7921 had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by
the Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information
brought to WHO’s attention that AH-7921 is clandestinely manufactured, poses
an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
AH-7921 has been shown in animals to be generally equipotent to morphine,
exhibiting a steep dose–response curve for respiratory depression. It is a μ-opioid
receptor agonist although its analgesic activity may also involve κ-opioid
receptors. AH-7921 is a central nervous system depressant. In addition to
analgesia, relaxation, euphoria, so-called opiate glow, and alertness, occasional
itching, nausea and tremors have been described by self-reporting users. Various
analytically confirmed non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving AH-7921 have
been reported in the literature.

Dependence potential
No studies have examined the dependence potential of AH-7921 in vitro, in
animals or in humans. There have been few studies on the dependence/abuse
potential of AH-7921 and no specific studies in humans. However, dependence
liability studies in animals showed that AH-7921 produced a withdrawal
syndrome similar to that observable for morphine using a similar dose schedule.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
AH-7921 abuse and/or seized material has been reported in nine countries.
AH-7921 use appears to be associated with the purchase of so-called research
chemicals or equivalent products via the Internet.

Therapeutic usefulness
Although investigated as an opioid for analgesia, AH-7921 has no recorded
therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
AH-7921 is an opioid with “morphine-like” effects. The Committee considered
that the degree of risk to public health and society associated with the abuse
liability and accompanying evidence warranted its placement under international
control. Therapeutic use has not been recorded. The Committee recommended
that AH-7921 be placed in Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention, as amended
by the 1972 Protocol.

9.3.22 Methoxetamine
Substance identification
Methoxetamine is an arylcyclohexylamine and is chemically 2-(3-methoxy
phenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone. It has two enantiomers and is commonly
available as the racemic mixture.

Previous review
Methoxetamine had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed
by the Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information
brought to WHO’s attention that methoxetamine is clandestinely manufactured,
poses an especially serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized
therapeutic use by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and
from different countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm
and that it has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Methoxetamine shows some structural and pharmacological similarities to
ketamine. Data suggest that methoxetamine has N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor antagonistic activity, similar to ketamine, and functions as a dopamine
and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is reported to have longer lasting and
more powerful adverse effects than ketamine but with weaker analgesic and
anaesthetic effects. Specifically, although not formally profiled, methoxetamine is
described as a dissociative anaesthetic with hallucinogenic effects also like those
of ketamine. Adverse effects following methoxetamine consumption have been
reported to be vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, hypertension, tachycardia and, in
some cases, central nervous system depression. Although various non-fatal and
fatal intoxications involving methoxetamine have been reported in the literature,
they have also involved other drugs and manners of death.

Dependence potential
No studies have examined the dependence potential of methoxetamine in vitro,
in animals or in humans.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
Methoxetamine abuse and/or seized material has been reported in 14 countries.
Methoxetamine use appears to be associated with the purchase of so-called
research chemicals or equivalent products via the Internet.

Therapeutic usefulness
Methoxetamine has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
Owing to the current insufficiency of data regarding dependence, abuse and
risks to public health, the Committee recommended that methoxetamine not be
placed under international control at this time but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.23 Methiopropamine (MPA)
Substance identification
Methiopropamine (MPA) is chemically 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane,
which is a structural analogue of methamphetamine in which the phenyl group has
been replaced with a thiophene ring.

Previous review
MPA had not been previously pre-reviewed or critically reviewed by the
Committee. A direct critical review was proposed based on information brought
to WHO’s attention that MPA is clandestinely manufactured, poses an especially
serious risk to public health and society, and has no recognized therapeutic use
by any party. Preliminary data collected from the literature and from different
countries indicated that this substance may cause substantial harm and that it
has no medical use.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
MPA shows some structural and pharmacological similarities to methamphetamine.
It functions primarily as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor and,
secondarily, as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MPA is a central nervous system
stimulant and displays methamphetamine-like properties including stimulation,
alertness and increase of focus and energy. Side-effects following administration
that have been reported are tachycardia, anxiety, panic attacks, perspiration,
headache, nausea, difficulty in breathing, vomiting, difficulty urinating and sexual
dysfunction. Although some non-fatal and fatal intoxications involving MPA have
been reported in the literature, they have also involved other drugs or else data to
allow assessment have been limited.

Dependence potential
No studies have examined the dependence potential of MPA in vitro, in animals
or in humans.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
MPA abuse and/or seized material has been reported in 10 countries. MPA use
appears to be associated with the purchase of so-called research chemicals or
equivalent products via the Internet.

Therapeutic usefulness
MPA has no recorded therapeutic applications or medical use.

Recommendation
Owing to the current insufficiency of data regarding dependence, abuse and risks
to public health, the Committee recommended that MPA not be placed under
international control at this time but be kept under surveillance.

9.3.24 Ketamine (INN)
Substance identification
Ketamine is (±)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)-cyclohexanone. It contains
a chiral centre, resulting in two enantiomers: S-(+)-ketamine and R-(–)-ketamine.
Usually, the racemate is marketed, but the more active S-(+)-enantiomer is
increasingly present in commercially available preparations.

Previous review
Ketamine had been pre-reviewed by the ECDD at its thirty-third meeting, at
which a recommendation was made for a critical review. At its thirty-fourth
meeting, the ECDD carried out a critical review of ketamine and concluded that
the information available was not sufficient to warrant scheduling. Also in view
of the activities of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs regarding ketamine in its
forty-ninth session held in March 2006, at the thirty-fourth meeting, the ECDD
requested the Secretariat to produce an updated version of the critical review
and present it to the next Committee meeting. At its thirty-fifth meeting, and on
the basis of the critical review undertaken, the Committee decided that bringing
ketamine under international control was not appropriate. At its fifty-seventh
session in March 2014, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs adopted Resolution
57/10 on preventing the diversion of ketamine from legal sources while ensuring
its availability for medical use. The Commission stated a concern regarding the
threat to the well-being of people and society posed by the diversion of ketamine
and by the rising trend in the abuse and trafficking of that substance. A notification
was made by the Government of the People’s Republic of China, under Article 2,
paragraph 1 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), concerning
the proposed recommendation for international control of ketamine. The
information provided by China with its notification to the Secretary-General was
brought to the Expert Committee’s attention.

Similarity to known substances and effects on the central nervous system
Ketamine is an anaesthetic that binds to the so-called phencyclidine (PCP)-binding
site of the NMDA-receptor complex as a non-competitive antagonist. Several
studies indicate that opioid receptors are also involved in the pharmacological
analgesic effects of ketamine. In non-fatal intoxications, anxiety (especially in
first-time users), agitation, changes of perception (e.g. loss of notion of danger
or visual disturbances), disorientation and impairment of motor function, such
as ataxia and dystonic reaction have been described. Reported intoxications
typically involve other drugs and ketamine was the sole intoxicant in only a very
limited number of fatalities.

Dependence potential
Ketamine may produce dependence in animal models, but reports of dependence
in humans are rare. The short duration of action makes it difficult to maintain
intoxication for sustained periods. Tolerance may occur, but there is insufficient
evidence to show that ketamine causes a withdrawal syndrome in humans.

Actual abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse
In many countries, levels of abuse in the general population appear to be low.
However, some countries report higher levels of abuse. There are reports on
ketamine abuse in certain groups with access to the substance (e.g. medical and
veterinarian professionals) and by people who use drugs. Ketamine is difficult to
synthesize, so illicit manufacture is rare in most countries. The INCB and UNODC
have reported that illicit manufacture of ketamine is of increasing concern in east
and south-east Asia. Information supplied by China with its notification to the
Secretary-General stated that in China “illegal ketamine production is becoming
increasingly serious”.

Therapeutic usefulness
Ketamine is widely used as an anaesthetic in humans and is the anaesthetic of
choice in veterinary medicine. Ketamine is included in the WHO Model List
of essential medicines (7) and the WHO Model List of essential medicines for
children (9) as well as in many national lists of essential medicines. Ketamine has
analgesic, hypnotic and short-term memory loss (amnesic) effects and is useful
for induction of anaesthesia, procedural sedation and analgesia. Compelling
evidence was presented about the prominent place of ketamine as an anaesthetic
in developing countries and crisis situations. The ease of parenteral administration
gives ketamine a major advantage when anaesthetic gases are impossible to use
owing to limited equipment and a lack of appropriately trained specialists.

Recommendation
Ketamine is a widely used anaesthetic, especially in developing countries, because
it is easy to use and has a wide margin of safety when compared with other
anaesthetic agents. While the Committee acknowledged the concerns raised by
some countries and UN organizations, ketamine abuse currently does not appear
to pose a sufficient public-health risk of global scale to warrant scheduling.
Consequently, the Committee recommended that ketamine not be placed under
international control at this time. Countries with serious abuse problems may
decide to introduce or maintain control measures, but should ensure ready access
to ketamine for surgery and anaesthesia for human and veterinary care.

9.4.1     Lisdexamfetamine (INN)
Summary
Lisdexamfetamine, chemical name (2S)-2,6-diamino-N-[(2S)-1-phenylpropan-
2-yl]hexanamide,(2S)-2,6-diamino-N-[(1S)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]
hexanamidedimethanesulfonate, had not previously been reviewed by the
Committee.
         As a central nervous system stimulant, lisdexamfetamine is used as an
adjunct in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
As a pro-drug, lisdexamfetamine was specifically designed as an abuse-
resistant product. After oral administration and absorption, enzyme hydrolysis
following contact with red blood cells will break lisdexamfetamine into lysine,
a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and active dexamfetamine, which is
responsible for the substance’s pharmacological activity. The safety and efficacy
of lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of ADHD in children and adults has
been established and the toxicology and adverse effect profile appears similar
to other stimulant drugs for this indication. Although lisdexamfetamine self-
administration is limited in preclinical and clinical studies, lisdexamfetamine
does produce similar subjective and discriminative effects to those of
dexamfetamine in humans and animals, respectively. The observation in
preclinical studies that lisdexamfetamine produces substantial and sustained
increases in catecholaminergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex
and striatum without inducing locomotor activation is consistent with the
clinical observations that lisdexamfetamine has a long duration of action and
a reasonable separation between its beneficial effects in treating ADHD and
the induction of psychostimulant adverse events. To date, there appears to be
little evidence of non-medical use of lisdexamfetamine based on data from
DAWN Live (Drug Abuse Warning Network1), Internet and media monitoring,
supply-chain monitoring, post-marketing adverse event reports, and Researched
Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS®) especially in
comparison to immediate-release stimulant medicines for ADHD. Nevertheless,
the fact that lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug of dexamfetamine implies a need for
similar clinical oversight and precautions for the monitoring and scheduling of
this central nervous system stimulant.

Recommendation
Based on the evidence available regarding dependence, abuse and risks to public
health, the Committee recommended that a critical review for lisdexamfetamine
is not warranted at this time.

9.4.2       Tramadol (INN)
Summary
Tramadol is (±)-trans-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclo-
hexanol. Tramadol was pre-reviewed for the first time at the twenty-
eighth meeting of the ECDD in 1992. The Committee did not recommend a critical
review on the basis of its low abuse liability as indicated by human studies on its
subjective effects and the absence of significant abuse. At the thirty-second meet-
ing of the ECDD in 2000, tramadol was again pre-reviewed. The Committee noted
significant numbers of cases of withdrawal syndrome and dependence reported
as adverse drug reactions, as well as its potential to produce dependence of the
morphine type, and recommended critical review of tramadol. At its thirty-third
meeting in 2002, the Committee decided that the information was not sufficient
to recommend international control of tramadol, but was adequate to recommend
that WHO keep the substance under surveillance. Subsequently, tramadol was pre-
reviewed at the thirty-fourth ECDD meeting in 2006. Considering that tramadol
continued to show a low level of abuse, even following the major increase in the
extent of its therapeutic use, the Committee concluded that there was not sufficient
evidence to justify a critical review. Following the adoption of the CND Resolution
56/14 in 2013 regarding “strengthening international cooperation in addressing
the non-medical use and abuse, the illicit manufacture and the illicit domestic and
international distribution of tramadol”, the substance was presented by the WHO
Secretariat for pre-review at the present meeting.
            The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a public health surveillance system that monitors drug-
related hospital emergency department visits in order to report on the impact of drug use, misuse, and
abuse in metropolitan areas and across the United States of America.
          Tramadol is an analgesic with a multimode of action. It acts on serotonergic
and noradrenergic nociception, while its metabolite O-desmethyltramadol
acts on the μ-opioid receptor. Its analgesic potency is claimed to be about one
tenth that of morphine. Tramadol is used to treat both acute and chronic pain
of moderate to (moderately) severe intensity. Tramadol monotherapy does not
usually provide adequate analgesia. In treating chronic non-cancer pain, there
is little evidence for the use of tramadol for more than three months. Tramadol
is considered to be a relatively safe analgesic. The main adverse reactions to
tramadol therapy are nausea, dizziness, and vomiting, particularly at the start
of the therapy. At therapeutic doses, tramadol does not cause clinically relevant
respiratory depression. Tramadol is contraindicated, however, in patients with
diminished respiratory function. Tramadol is generally considered as a medicine
with a low potential for dependence relative to morphine. Nevertheless, tramadol
dependence may occur when it is used for prolonged periods (more than several
weeks to months). Dependence on tramadol may occur when used within the
recommended dose range but especially when used at supra-therapeutic doses.
In many individuals with tramadol dependence, a substance abuse history is
found. Orally administered tramadol can produce opioid-like effects (both
mental and physical) but these effects are mild and not produced following
parenteral administration. Tramadol is generally considered as a medicine with
a low abuse potential relative to morphine, and this potential is associated with
high-dose oral tramadol. At supra-therapeutic doses, and rarely at therapeutic
doses, intoxications may occur. Symptoms of tramadol intoxication are similar to
those of other opioid analgesics but may include serotonergic and noradrenergic
components. Symptoms include central nervous system depression and coma,
tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse, seizures, and respiratory depression up to
respiratory arrest. Fatal intoxications are rare and appear to be associated with
large overdoses of tramadol and co-ingestion of other drugs (including alcohol).
          Tramadol is used worldwide and is listed in many medical guidelines
for pain treatment. Tramadol is also included on several national essential
medicines lists. It is, however, not included in the 18th WHO Model List of
Essential Medicines (April 2013) (7). It is mentioned as a step-2 analgesic in the
WHO guidelines on cancer pain relief (10). There is growing evidence of abuse
of tramadol in some African and Asian countries where there have been large
seizures of such preparations. Tramadol is widely available via the Internet without
a prescription. Websites provide many user reports on the non-medicinal use of
tramadol. The legal status of tramadol differs internationally. In most countries,
it is a prescription-only medicine.

Recommendation
Based on the evidence available regarding dependence, abuse and risks to public
health, the Committee recommended that a critical review of tramadol is not
warranted at this time.
